# Service Descriptions


In this section you can find the AlmaCare Service Description.

## AlmaCare


### 1. Introduction

In March 2023, TuxCare, a division of CloudLinux Inc., launched, in partnership with Sirius, AlmaCare, an accessible enterprise support extension for AlmaLinux. It provides two levels of support, the essential level, focused on the operating system, and the enhanced support extension focused on applications.

This document defines those services that will be provided under the ‘AlmaCare Support Service’.

### 2. Overview of Services and Service Providers 

**Overview of Services**

TuxCare support will consist of two offerings. These services are defined in detail in the ‘Support Service Categories’ section below, however, at high-level they are summarised as follows:
* **Essential Support** - a limited offering that just covers software updates, software packaging, repository access to the AlmaLinux distribution, as well as support for the live patching technology
* **Enhanced Support** - a bespoke enterprise support service, by arrangement for individual clients and covering a range of open source software running on AlmaLinux


**TuxCare, a division of CloudLinux Inc.**

TuxCare develops and enhances AlmaCare, providing additional capabilities, features and support on the community AlmaLinux distribution, and continues to contribute in the development of the AlmaLinux distribution. From an AlmaCare support perspective, TuxCare provides technical engineering and maintenance of AlmaCare and provides technical expertise for the AlmaLinux codebase.

TuxCare will provide **Essential Support**, **Enhanced Support** as well as ‘3rd-line support’ & engineering input to codebase issues escalated to them by Sirius. Escalated issues are expected to be rare and only raised where CloudLinux may be thought to have specialist insight or detailed knowledge related to the AlmaLinux codebase.

**Sirius Open Source Inc.**
Sirius is a specialist Open Source technology service provider. Sirius has delivered development, support, maintenance and consultancy services (amongst others) in a broad range of Open Source technology since 1998.

For TuxCare Support, Sirius will deliver **Enhanced Support for AlmaCare** as set out at high level in this Service Definition document.

### 3. Accessing Support

#### Availability - Service Times

For each TuxCare enterprise client, Sirius will provide 24x7x365 support, irrespective of the client’s geographic location. This may be provided via the relevant Sirius day-shift team across multiple timezones.

#### Eligibility - Who can access support

**A. Enterprise Clients**

The vast majority of enterprise clients typically have their own IT support arrangements and will perform initial ‘1st-line’ support to triage and sign-post issues for resolution. For TuxCare support, the actual arrangements in place will be discussed with each TuxCare customer during the commercial onboarding and arrangements agreed.
Where a TuxCare customer has its own internal IT support, Sirius will agree nominated super-users or technical leads with the client. Those super-users will be entitled to fully access Support services from Sirius using the Tools and Processes set out below.
If required by a TuxCare customer, Sirius may provide direct end-user support on the Open Source services specified, for wider staff of individual Enterprise clients. This would be discussed during the commercial onboarding process and set out in the commercial agreement.

**B. Individual End-Users**

At this time, support to individual end-users who are non-enterprise clients is not included.

#### Tools and Methods 

Support services may be obtained using a number of different tools or channels.

* **Web based Ticketing System (Initially using Sirius’ ticketing solution)**
    * Enterprise clients will have direct access to the Sirius support ticketing system. (Sirius currently uses the OTRS* solution. *Open-Source Ticket Request System.)
    * User accounts will be created for each nominated user within each client organisation and a detailed user guide is provided showing how to access and query the system.
    * User accounts will have access to log, view and respond to tickets, within the Sirius support ticketing system.
    * An unlimited number of tickets can be created by each user
    * The ticketing system can be updated directly within the solution. Various actions can also be carried out on a ticket (e.g. responding to a message with a comment, asking a further question or asking for a ticket to be closed) by sending an email – using the appropriate format – shared during onboarding. 
* **Email**
    * New tickets can be created simply by emailing the Sirius support desk. This will be achieved by using a dedicated service desk email: [premium-support@tuxcare.com](mailto:premium-support@tuxcare.com)
* **Telephone**
    * Enterprise clients may create a support ticket or discuss an existing ticket by calling the Sirius support desk telephone number during the availability hours specified in this service definition document.
    * The direct support number depends on the geographic region of the client and is as follows:
        * US Territory  +1(509) 254 5005
        * EMEA Territory  +44(333) 344 5055

* **Web based Knowledgebase, Community Forum & Wiki**
    * For Individual End-users that may not have the benefit of Enterprise support, Sirius will help provide end-users with URL links to relevant documentation and community support available. Specifically:
        * AlmaLinux - TuxCare will include URL links to relevant community forums such as [https://wiki.almalinux.org/](https://wiki.almalinux.org/) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/AlmaLinux/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlmaLinux/)
        * For all other Open Source software products, Sirius will help provide links for end-users to recognised documentation and community forums wherever possible

#### Processes

From a client perspective, all processes involved in accessing support are those required to create and maintain support tickets. (Other relevant processes would be for accessing Change Control, Escalation and Service Review. For those, please see the relevant sections in this document.)

**Using the Support Ticketing System**
* Logging a Support Ticket
* Updating a Support Ticket
* Closing a Support Ticket

The detailed processes for using our web-based ticketing system are set out in our Ticketing System User Guide (supplied to all enterprise clients during onboarding).

#### Maintenance Windows

For the support service, maintenance windows enable planned service interruptions to any appropriate software systems, telemetry or monitoring tools that may be in use, so that essential maintenance, repairs, housekeeping or service upgrades can be carried out.

As far as is possible, any such maintenance windows are unlikely to fully impact the support service and in any case will be arranged at times that cause minimum disruption to the support services set out in this service definition.

Any maintenance that would be service impacting will be raised and notified through the agreed change management process and approved first, except where any work is required to restore services after a system failure.

### 4. Governance

#### Security and GDPR

All service providers are required to conform with applicable legislation regarding data protection (such as the General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR) and with good practice regarding systems security and data privacy.

In delivering the TuxCare support service, certain information will need to be captured about the organisations receiving that service and individuals that request it. Appropriate security measures shall be established and maintained to protect all relevant information and all systems that are involved.

Sirius is an ISO27001 (Security) certified organisation and maintains comprehensive security policies and procedures. Management of security and data protection will be controlled as set out in the Sirius ‘Information Security and Quality Policy’.

In the event of any data breach or security concern being identified by any of the parties (including a TuxCare customer), these should be reported using the defined ‘Incident Reporting Process’. This process is set out during onboarding of the TuxCare client, when the full process will be agreed. Further details are available from the Sirius nominated Data Protection Officer (currently Mr. Simon King, at the time of issue of this document).

#### Data Captured

To deliver the support and project services specified, certain specific data are required to be captured. These include the following:



| **Data Item** | **Location Held** | **Personally Identifiable Data? (PID)** |
|------|:------:|:------:|
|Client Organisation Name|Ticketing System|N|
|User Name|Ticketing System|Y|
|User Email Address (assuming this will be an enterprise email rather than personal)|Ticketing System|N|
|User Telephone Number(s)|Ticketing System|N|


#### Privacy

The need to ensure the privacy of all client data is taken very seriously by the service providers responsible for delivering the TuxCare support service. A privacy policy will be defined and agreed with each Enterprise client on entering into commercial arrangements.

*Guidance Notes on measurement criteria*

*NB. Times shown are response times, with those in brackets being fix times. Asterisks indicate that a response/fix time may be agreed with the client.*

*Criteria Descriptions follow below:*


| | |
|---|:---|
|**Urgency**|*The measure of criticality of an incident or problem based on the business needs of the client.*|
|Critical|Affects the entire service (**e.g. an AlmaLinux server is unavailable in its entirety**)|
|Urgent|Affects the business needs of several business-critical functions in one service area (**e.g. a particular part or major functional component of AlmaLinux is unavailable**)|
|Important|Affects the business needs of one business critical function (**e.g. errors are encountered but primary functions are available for use**)|
|Non-Urgent|Affects the needs of a client and a work around exists.|
|Minor|Affects a non-business function. Non fault based Change Request. Normal Service Request.|
| | |
|**Impact**|*The extent to which an incident leads to distortion of agreed or expected service levels.*|
|High|Critically affecting a large number of users.|
|Medium|Critically affecting one user and limits them from working.|
|Low|Affecting one user but does not stop them working.|

### 7. Change Control

Any significant change to the TuxCare Support Services will be carried out in accordance with the TuxCare Support Services change control process. 

### 8. Monitoring and Reporting

#### Customer Ticket reviews

Regular ticket reviews will be carried out to monitor service delivery.

**Monthly reviews** will monitor solution performance using quantitative measures (for example: no. of tickets raised/open/closed, response times/SLA), quarterly reviews will use qualitative measures (for example: how are we doing, lessons learned). To enable reporting to be proportionate to the services taken and the amount of monitoring required, these metrics will be agreed with each individual client during the onboarding process.

Sirius will therefore generate monthly ticket reports and hold a review call with each individual TuxCare customer to review usage and performance. These will be held at the support management level and attended by a representative or representatives from the TuxCare customer and Sirius’ support team.

**Quarterly reviews** will be held (either by conference call or in person) at the account management level. These will be open in format and be used to review any operational management or commercial refinements needed. These will be attended by the relevant business lead at the TuxCare customer and the Sirius account manager responsible for that customer.

#### Overall TuxCare Support Services Review

**Service Quality, Volume management and capacity planning**

Delivery of TuxCare Support services across all TuxCare clients will be monitored through quarterly service management meetings between CloudLinux and Sirius for the overall service. Factors reviewed will be service quality, measured by aggregate reports of ticket metrics and customer feedback as well as volume and capacity planning based on existing TuxCare client volumes and future projections. Factors that influence service quality and delivery will also be considered, such as any variance in the performance of any of the technical solutions covered under support.

**Escalation Process**

Service delivery of TuxCare support services will be managed according to the definitions set out in this document. In the event of any concern from CloudLinux or Sirius with the effectiveness of the governance or processes used, the first point of escalation would be via the quarterly service management meetings. In the unlikely event of any urgent escalations for critical service delivery issues, direct escalation can be made to key contacts as follows:

* For CloudLinux: David Mello, Chief Experience Officer ([dmello@cloudlinux.com](mailto:dmello@cloudlinux.com))

* For Sirius: Andrew Bucknor, CEO, Sirius UK ([andrew.bucknor@siriusopensource.com](mailto:andrew.bucknor@siriusopensource.com))
