# Extended Lifecycle Support for Languages

## Extended Lifecycle Support for PHP

Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) for PHP from TuxCare provides security fixes for PHP versions that have reached their end-of-life. This allows to continue running Linux server vulnerability-free.

### Installation instructions

#### RHEL based systems

1. Download an installer script:

```
wget https://repo.cloudlinux.com/php-els/install-php-els-repo.sh
```

2. Run the installer script with keys. The installation script registers the server in the CLN with the key, adds the yum repository, and adds a PGP key to the server.

```
sh install-php-els-repo.sh --license-key XXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

3. Verify that the installation was successful.

To ensure the installation has been completed successfully, run the following command. It should return the info about an available package. If information about the package will be available, it would mean that installation was successful. After that, updates will be available for installation from the repository using the usual yum upgrade command.

```
yum info alt-php73

To install all versions at the same time, use group:

```
yum groupinstall alt-php
```

Run the installer script with keys:

```
bash install-php-els-ubuntu-repo.sh --license-key XXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
```

To ensure the installation has been completed successfully, run the following command. It should return the info about an available package. If information about the package will be available, it would mean that installation was successful. After that, updates will be available for installation from the repository using the usual apt upgrade command.
